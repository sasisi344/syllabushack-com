# Content Category Rules

Syllabus Hack content is strictly divided into three categories. Articles must be placed in `content/blog/{category}/`.

## 1. trend (トレンド・試験情報)
**"News & Context"**
*   **Directory**: `content/blog/trend/`
*   **Content**:
    *   Syllabus updates (e.g., "IPA adds GenAI to syllabus").
    *   Exam schedule and logistics.
    *   Latest AI industry news relevant to exams.
    *   "Is this certification still worth it?" type analysis.

## 2. method (学習メソッド)
**"The Solution (Syllabus Hack)"**
*   **Directory**: `content/blog/method/`
*   **Content**:
    *   **Core Hacks**: How to use AI for studying.
    *   **Tools/Prompts**: "Infinite Drill Generator", "Syllabus Scheduler".
    *   **Reports**: "I passed using this method" (Success stories that validate the method).
    *   **Tutorials**: Specific algorithm explanations using metaphors.

## 3. career (キャリア戦略)
**"The Outcome"**
*   **Directory**: `content/blog/career/`
*   **Content**:
    *   Job market data for qualification holders.
    *   How to build a portfolio using what you studied.
    *   Career paths (e.g., "From Non-IT to Engineer").
    *   Salary surveys.

## Decision Tree
1.  Is it about *how to pass* or *study tools*? -> **method**
2.  Is it about *what happens after passing* or *jobs*? -> **career**
3.  Is it about *the exam itself* (dates, changes) or *industry trends*? -> **trend**
